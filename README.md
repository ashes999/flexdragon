# FlexDragon

Flex Dragon is a Python static website generator for blogs and content-heavy websites. You can create websites by writing content in markdown and providing a layout (CSS/HTML/Javascript/etc.). FlexDragon generates the resulting HTML for the website to be statically hosted (eg. on `github.io`), including *interesting things* like RSS feed generation.

You can see our current roadmap on the [v1.0 Epic issue](https://github.com/ashes999/flexdragon/issues/1).
